<p>See <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD record</a> for Joan,
Peter’s records; John’s birth record is a little more difficult to work
out.</p>
<p>Joan Brett <a
href="https://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/joan-brett-24-c2tls">married
Alistair William Hay</a> — presumably subject of <a
href="https://manifestmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/manifestn2.pdf">this
article</a>.</p>
<p>Joan and Alistair William had three children (from conversation with
Martin Brett) - Alison, Sally and <a
href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Hay/index.html">John</a>.</p>
<p>The BBC has some <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/21/a7538321.shtml">reminiscences
by Alison Keating (née Hay) about the war</a>, her father’s death, and
her mother, and <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7538466.shtml">more
reminiscences about her father</a>.</p>
<p>Peter Brett apparently worked for ICI in Cheshire (Martin B).</p>
<p>He married twice.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://woodenships.co.uk/sailing-yacht/dee-25">designed
boats</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Brett is best known nowadays as the designer of the famous
Rival range of yachts.</p>
<p>The Dee 25 Class was one of his early successes and subsequently
evolved into the Rival 31.</p>
<p>He designed the first boat, Fair Rover for himself, the design was
featured in Yachting World magazine in 1951 and she proved very
successful in his local Irish Seas races.</p>
<p>10 more Dee 25s followed.</p>
<p>No 2 Rondinella is a name many people will know, winning the Cowes
Dinard Race in 1959 and the only boat in Class 111 to finish the 1965
Channel Race – see Adlard Coles, Heavy Weather Sailing.</p>
<p>All the Dee 25s were built by Allansons of Freckleton on the
Lancashire coast and the class that followed was named after the River
Dee at Freckleton.</p>
<p>Such was the success of Fair Rover, the yard went on to build another
9 boats to the same design.</p>
