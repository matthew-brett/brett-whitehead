      <description>There is a Mary Ann Brett at this MyHeritage.com page that appears to match John Brett’s partner and Michael’s mother.
FeeBMD has no record of a marriage between “John Brett” and someone with surname “Howcroft” between 1840 and 1902. Christiana Payne’s biography notes that “as far as anyone has been able to ascertain, John Brett and Mary Ann Howcroft […] were never actually married.”
The record for John Brett’s household in the 1881 census records these household members at No 6 Keswick Road, London:</description>

See Charles Curtis Brett’s wikitree entry. This says that he married Ann “Pilbin” on 12 June 1823. The Dictionary of National Biography has this as “Pilbean”, and Ann’s birth year as 1808/9 - see page on John Brett (painter).

      <description>Clara Louisa’s parents were George Braginton and Margaret Grace Vicary.
Also see this page on Braginton family history.
From that page: Clara Louisa’s father was a shipowner, and probably named one of his ships “Clara Louisa” after his daughter.
Clara was born in 1837 - see BMD record.
Clara Louisa married Edmund Allen Johns in 1857. They had three children. Edmund Allen died in 1864.
Clara Louisa married Henry Alfred Langford in 1866.</description>

      <description>Henry A Langford married Clara Louisa Johns (née Braginton) in 1866, in Plymouth (BMD record).
This Burke’s peerage entry states that Helena Emmeline Langford was the daughter of Henry A. Langford.
Apart from Helena Emmeline, there was only one other Langford born in Plymouth between 1864 and 1890 - Albert Leonard Langford, in 1868 (BMD record).
Albert Leonard Langford died at age 11, also in Plymouth, which would explain why he is not in Clara Louisa’s Household in the 1881 census (BMD record).</description>

Farwell was vicar at Zennor, Cornwall from 1888 to 1900. From this blog on an historical diary about Saint Senara’s church at Zennor:
 However, by the late 19th Century the Church had become neglected and when the Reverend Samuel Henry Farwell Roe became Vicar in 1888 he realised it was in need of restoration.</description>

      <description>Conversation between Matthew and Martin Brett, 10 May 2020 Helena Emmeline preferred “Emmeline”.
Emmeline lived with “Aunt Alice” and an unfriendly vicar in Zennor, in Cornwall. She (Granny Whitehead) would do an impression of the thick accent of the postman.
A distant relative, surname Johns, gave a significant amount of money to Emmeline in his will, enough to buy a car.</description>
