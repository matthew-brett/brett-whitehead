      <description>There is a Mary Ann Brett at this MyHeritage.com page that appears to match John Brett’s partner and Michael’s mother.
FeeBMD has no record of a marriage between “John Brett” and someone with surname “Howcroft” between 1840 and 1902. Christiana Payne’s biography notes that “as far as anyone has been able to ascertain, John Brett and Mary Ann Howcroft […] were never actually married.”
The record for John Brett’s household in the 1881 census records these household members at No 6 Keswick Road, London:</description>

      <description>Conversation between Matthew and Martin Brett, 10 May 2020 Helena Emmeline preferred “Emmeline”.
Emmeline lived with “Aunt Alice” and an unfriendly vicar in Zennor, in Cornwall. She (Granny Whitehead) would do an impression of the thick accent of the postman.
A distant relative, surname Johns, gave a significant amount of money to Emmeline in his will, enough to buy a car.</description>
