<p>I can’t find Clara Louisa in the 1891 census. This may be because she
had emigrated to the United States; in <a
href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/b86617aa-7793-4abf-9b2b-ad28d109ed29">this
23 September 1892 record of a conveyance</a>, along with some other
familiar dramatis personae, Clara Louisa is listed as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clara Louisa Langford of New York, U.S.A., widow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting that she seems to have emigrated to the US on her
own, leaving her family behind; at least, she has not changed her
surname for the conveyance documents.</p>
<p>I can’t find any plausible record of her travel to the US in the US
immigration databases, searching for “Langford”, “Clara” and
“Louisa”.</p>
<p><a href="/brett-whitehead/brett-whitehead/">Martin Brett</a> tells me that he
remembers a visitor to the family home, who was from Canada, and who was
a friend of some family of his grandmother <a
href="/brett-whitehead/helena-emmeline-langford/">Emmeline</a>, who was living in the
family home with Emmeline’s daughter and Martin’s mother, Joy Whitehead.
The visitor was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a Miss Grenfell, and she visited us once or twice, I think just
before we left Eltham - so say 1949-51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin thought Miss Grenfell was a friend of fairly close family,
because she was invited more than once. The rest of Clara’s children and
grandchildren appear to be accounted for (see links above), so maybe
Miss Grenfell had known Clara, or Clara’s family.</p>
