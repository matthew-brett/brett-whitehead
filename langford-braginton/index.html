<p>From the <a

Morning News - Thursday 06 November 1879</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FATAL FALL AT PLYMOUTH.</p>
<p>A shocking accident occurred near the Plymouth Hoe between seven and
eight o’clock last evening. It is stated that some boys were engaged
lighting a bonfire in the quarry under the Hoe, and a boy named Albert
Leonard Langford clambered over the wall which runs around the upper
part of the quarry, into the field above. Probably in reaching over to
see what was going below, and the grass being damp and slippery, the
unfortunate lad missed his footing and fell over the rocks to the bottom
of the quarry, which is here at least hundred feet high. The fall was
observed by several persons who ran to the spot, and with the aid of the
Hoe constable. Mr. Coulton removed the boy to the South Devon Hospital,
But the injuries he had sustained were so severe death most have been
almost instantaneous. A sad feature in the case was that the lad was
utterly unknown to anyone on the spot, and up to a late hour last night
the body lay at the hospital unrecognised. It was then identified his
step brother and sister. The deceased, who was about eleven years of
age, resided with mother, a widow lady, at 5, North Hill-terrace.</p>

Salisbury Times - Saturday 08 November 1879</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An inquest was held on Thursday, at Plymouth, on the body of Albert
Leonard Langford, aged 11, which was picked up in a quarry, at the west
end of Plymouth Hoe, on Wednesday night. Deceased with two companions,
had gone out to see the Guy Fawkes’ celebrations, and was watching a
bonfire which had been kindled in the quarry. To get a better view he
climbed a wall at the edge, from the top of which there was a sheer
precipice of 120 feet, and fell over. A verdict of accidental death was
returned, and the jury expressed an opinion that some further precaution
against such accidents should be taken at such a dangerous spot.</p>
