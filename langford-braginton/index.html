<p>The couple probably had two children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Albert Leonard (1868-1879) (see below).</li>
<li><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/helena-emmeline-langford/">Helena Emmeline</a> (1872-1949).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="albert-leonard-langford">Albert Leonard Langford</h2>
<p>Apart from Helena Emmeline, there was only one other Langford born in Plymouth between 1864 and 1890 - Albert Leonard Langford, in 1868 (<a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD record</a>).</p>
<p>Albert Leonard Langford died at age 11, in 1879, soon after his father, after <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/docs/langford_al_death_cert_1879.pdf">“accidentally falling over the side of a quarry”</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/18791106/061/0003">Western Morning News - Thursday 06 November 1879</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FATAL FALL AT PLYMOUTH.</p>
<p>A shocking accident occurred near the Plymouth Hoe between seven and eight o’clock last evening. It is stated that some boys were engaged lighting a bonfire in the quarry under the Hoe, and a boy named Albert Leonard Langford clambered over the wall which runs around the upper part of the quarry, into the field above. Probably in reaching over to see what was going below, and the grass being damp and slippery, the unfortunate lad missed his footing and fell over the rocks to the bottom of the quarry, which is here at least hundred feet high. The fall was observed by several persons who ran to the spot, and with the aid of the Hoe constable. Mr. Coulton removed the boy to the South Devon Hospital, But the injuries he had sustained were so severe death most have been almost instantaneous. A sad feature in the case was that the lad was utterly unknown to anyone on the spot, and up to a late hour last night the body lay at the hospital unrecognised. It was then identified his step brother and sister. The deceased, who was about eleven years of age, resided with mother, a widow lady, at 5, North Hill-terrace.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001603/18791108/067/0005">The Salisbury Times - Saturday 08 November 1879</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An inquest was held on Thursday, at Plymouth, on the body of Albert Leonard Langford, aged 11, which was picked up in a quarry, at the west end of Plymouth Hoe, on Wednesday night. Deceased with two companions, had gone out to see the Guy Fawkes’ celebrations, and was watching a bonfire which had been kindled in the quarry. To get a better view he climbed a wall at the edge, from the top of which there was a sheer precipice of 120 feet, and fell over. A verdict of accidental death was returned, and the jury expressed an opinion that some further precaution against such accidents should be taken at such a dangerous spot.</p>
