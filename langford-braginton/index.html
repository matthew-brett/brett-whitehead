		<p>Henry A Langford married <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/clara-louisa-braginton/">Clara Louisa Johns (née Braginton)</a> in 1866, in Plymouth:</p>
<pre><code>Marriages Jun 1866
LANGFORD     Henry A         Plymouth    5b 437</code></pre>
<p>This <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/burkes_whitehead/">Burke’s peerage entry</a> states that Helena Emmeline Langford was the daughter of Henry A. Langford.</p>
<p>Apart from Helena Emmeline, there was only one other Langford born in Plymouth between 1864 and 1890:</p>
<pre><code>Births Jun 1868   (&gt;99%)
LANGFORD     Albert Leonard      Plymouth    5b 265</code></pre>
<p>Albert Leonard Langford died at age 11, also in Plymouth, which would explain why he is not in Clara Louisa’s Household in 1881.</p>
<pre><code>Deaths Dec 1879   (&gt;99%)
Langford     Albert Leonard  11  Plymouth    5b 193</code></pre>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.gravestonephotos.com/public/gravedetails.php?grave=59397">grave for “Henry A Langford”</a> in St Mary’s Church, Callington, Cornwall, with inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Henry A Langford who departed this life June 24th 1879, aged 41 years. “His end was peace”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/langford_ha_probate_1881.jpg">Henry A Langford probate listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LANGFORD, Henry Albert. Personal estate £28 13s. 1881, 10 December. Administration of the Personal Estate of Henry Albert Langford late of Callington in the county of Cornwall Accountant who died 24 June 1879 in Callington was granted at Bodmin to Clara Louisa Langford of 5 North-Hill- terrace Plymouth in the County of Devon Widow of the Relict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966 - Ancestry.com - 1,1904::0 - 1,1904::5114587</p>
<p>Three things stand out from this probate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Henry Albert is living in Callington, which is about 15 miles away from Plymouth, where his children were born, and where his wife was living two years later for the census. Had he moved out?</li>
<li>The probate seems to have taken a long time; he died in June 1879, but the probate is resolved a year and half later in December 1881.</li>
<li>He only left £28; that seems strangely small given his profession “Accountant”.</li>
</ul>
