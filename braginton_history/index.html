<blockquote>
<p>George Braginton, the oldest son of Richard Braginton, was baptised
on 28 Feb 1808 in Ottery St Mary, Devon. On 13 Jan 1835, at St Giles in
the Wood, he married Margaret Grace Vicary, the widow of William Cotton.
Margaret Grace Vicary, the daughter of Thomas Cornish Vicary and
Margaret Fry, was baptised at Great Torrington, Devon on 6 Dec 1807. Her
marriage to William Cotton produced two children. Charles Newell Cotton
was born in Barnstaple on 24 Mar 1830 while his sister, Fanny Eleanor
William Cotton was born after the death of her father in Barnstaple on
26 Oct 1832.</p>
<p>George Braginton was a merchant and banker, and served as both an
alderman and as the mayor of Great Torrington on a number of occasions.
The Rolle Canal, completed in 1827 was leased to George from 1852 until
about 1865 when control of the canal passed to Mark Rolle. George was
also a shipowner. George BRAGINTON’s bank, Braginton, Rimington &amp;
Co., failed and George declared bankruptcy in 1865. He subsequenly faced
a number of lawsuits as a result of his “rash and hazardous” dealings,
and it wasn’t until 1874 that the bankruptcy was discharged.</p>
<p>George and Margaret Grace had six children baptised at St Giles in
the Wood: Margaret Ann (1835), Clara Louisa (1837), George Vicary
(1840), Georgina Merrill (1843), Alice Jane (1845) and Richard George
(1849). George Vicary Braginton was buried at St Giles in the Wood on 7
Jan 1842. Richard George Braginton was buried on 16 Jul 1850.</p>
<p>George lived at Moor House, St Giles in the Wood but moved to Compton
Gifford, Devon after his bankruptcy. Margaret Grace Vicary died 24 Nov
1868 at Compton Gifford. George married Emma Dobson in 1880, and died at
Compton Gifford on 9 Jan 1886. Both Margaret Grace and George are buried
in Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth.</p>
