Samuel Henry Farwell Roe was born in 1856 (BMD record). He was the son of the Reverend Henry Farwell Roe, Rector of Lesnewth, Cornwall, and Isabella Messenger (source).
Roe married Alice Jane Braginton in 1890.
Farwell was vicar at Zennor, Cornwall from 1888 to 1900. From this blog on an historical diary about Saint Senara’s church at Zennor:
However, by the late 19th Century the Church had become neglected and when the Reverend Samuel Henry Farwell Roe became Vicar in 1888 he realised it was in need of restoration.">

<p>Alice Jane died in 1923.</p>
<p>Farwell seems to have remarried to another Jane at some point - see
below. There’s a suggestion he was also married to a Winifred Mabel
Grieve - see below.</p>
<p>A puzzling factoid, possibly wrong, on <a
href="https://www.ancestry.co.uk/search/categories/42/?name=Mabel_Grieve&amp;name_x=s&amp;spouse=Henry_Ogle">Ancestry.com
for Mabel Grieve</a>:</p>

<p>Winifred Mabel Grieve from tree Lowe Family Tree</p>
<p>No publicly available LifeStory events</p>
<p>Record information.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Farwell does leave money to “Winifred Mabel Grieve, widow” in his
probate - see below, and does not leave money, apparently, to his wife
Jane, who was still alive (see grave below).</p>
<p>He died on 19 March 1943 (<a href="/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD
record</a>).</p>

26, 1943</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Death of Rev. H.S.F. Roe</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Henry Farwell Roe, who died at his residence, 5,
Hillsborough Terrace, Ilfracombe, on Friday, was prior to his retirement
in 1930 for 24 years Rector of St Pinnock parish near Liskcard,
Cornwall. During his Rectorship at St. Pinnock he was for a time Rural
Dean. He was Rector of Zennor from 1888 to 1900, and then for six years
Rector of St. Michael Penkevil. All his clerical career was spent in
Cornwall. Since he had been residing in Ilfracombe Mr. Roe had carried
out the duties of treasurer of the local auxiliary of the British and
Foreign Bible Society.</p>
