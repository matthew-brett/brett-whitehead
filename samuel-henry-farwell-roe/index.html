<p>Births Sep 1856</p>
<p>Roe Samuel Henry Farwell Camelford 5c 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/roe-braginton/">Farwell Roe married Alice Jane Braginton</a> in 1890.</p>
<p>Farwell was vicar at Zennor, Cornwall from 1888 to 1900. From this <a href="https://diaryofjamesstevens.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/the-restoration-of-zennor-church">blog on an historical diary</a> about Saint Senara’s church at Zennor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, by the late 19th Century the Church had become neglected and when the Reverend Samuel Henry Farwell Roe became Vicar in 1888 he realised it was in need of restoration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://west-penwith.org.uk/zennor93.htm">Farwell Roe was still at Zennor in 1893</a>.</p>
<p>He became vicar of St Michael Penkevil, in 1900. <a href="http://specialcollections.le.ac.uk/digital/api/collection/p16445coll4/id/270050/download&amp;usg=AOvVaw1aQX4xpSYSyAI0e5zGnZwC">Kelly’s Directory of Devon &amp; Cornwall, 1902. [Part 2: Cornwall, p 239 - 240]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The living is a rectory, net yearly value £102, with 50 acres of glebe and residence, in the gift of Viscount Falmouth, and held since 1900 by the Rev. Samuel Henry Farwell Roe, who is also rector (by dispensation) of Lamorran with Merther.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alice Jane died in 1923.</p>
<p>Farwell seems to have remarried to another Jane at some point - see below. There’s a suggestion he was also married to a Winifred Mabel Grieve - see below.</p>
<p>A puzzling factoid, possibly wrong, on <a href="https://www.ancestry.co.uk/search/categories/42/?name=Mabel_Grieve&amp;name_x=s&amp;spouse=Henry_Ogle">Ancestry.com for Mabel Grieve</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winifred Mabel Grieve from tree Lowe Family Tree</p>
<p>No publicly available LifeStory events</p>
<p>Record information.</p>
<p>Spouse Samuel Henry Farwell Roe (1856-year)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farwell does leave money to “Winifred Mabel Grieve, widow” in his probate - see below, and does not leave money, apparently, to his wife Jane, who was still alive.</p>
<p>He died on 19 March 1943.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deaths Mar 1943</p>
<p>ROE Samuel H F 86 Barnstaple 5b 567</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/124810872/farwell-roe">A grave from Marlborough Road Cemetery, Ilfracombe, Devon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sacred to the memory of Revd Farwell Roe died 19th March 1943</p>
<p>Also of Jane Roe, his wife, died 23rd February 1948.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/roe_shf_probate_1943.png">probate for a reverend Samuel Henry Farwell Roe</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ROE the reverend Samuel Henry Farwell of 5 Hillsborough-terrace Ilfracombe Devonshire died 19 March 1943 Probate Llandudno 5 August to Isabel Henriette Bertha Roe spinster and Winifred Mabel Grieve widow. Effects £11650 7s. 10d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jane Roe, Farwell’s wife, died in 1948:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deaths Mar 1948</p>
<p>Roe Jane 69 Barnstaple 7a 293</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her probate has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ROE, Jane of Northcote Torrs Park Ilfracombe Devonshire widow died 23rd February 1948 Probate London 10 June to Barclays Bank Limited. Effects £10145 14s. 11d.</p>
