		<p>According to a <a href="http://www.thepeerage.com/p31678.htm#i316772">Peerage.com page on Sir James Whitehead</a>, Gilbert Hinds Whitehead was the fifth child (and third son) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_James_Whitehead,_1st_Baronet">Sir James Whitehead, 1st Baronet</a> and Mercy Matilda Hinds.</p>
<p>He was born 26th May 1866, and <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/helena-emmeline-langford/">married Helena Emmeline Langford</a> in 1901.</p>
<p>In 1890, he became a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers and a Freeman of the City of London — see his profile in the <a href="https://archives.fruiterers.org.uk/gallery/816/">archives of the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers</a>. His <a href="https://archives.fruiterers.org.uk/gallery_image/4294/enlarge/">application to be a Freeman</a> has his signature:</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://archive.org/details/armorialfamilies02foxd">Armorial families by Fox-Davies (1905)</a> (p 2079) has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gilbert Hinds Whitehead, Esq., late Capt. 8th Vol. Batt. Rifle Brigade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilbert was the assignee of a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US754311A/en">1903 patent for interleaving printed sheets of paper with tissue paper</a>.</p>
<p>Martin Brett:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He and his younger brother together ran a lithographic printing company — hence the invention for interleaving plates with tissue paper. Their big sellers were one of the versions of Holman Hunt’s Light of the World and a rather terrifying print of a heavily tattooed Maori woman, both found very widely in the nurseries of their acquaintance. […] Entry into a livery company was standard for moderately prosperous commercial families, I think, and it was largely formulaic. I don’t believe Grandfather W. ever had any significant interest in fruit-selling.</p>
<p>The address in the armorial is the house which was built for them by Gt Grandfafher James, where Granny W. lived (except for part of the second war) until her death in 1951. I was born in the Eltham hospital when Granny Joy, Sue and Jen were looking for a permanent home, and my father was long at sea, and we returned there from Devon in (I think) early 1947. After Granny Whitehead’s death the house was sold and we moved to Surrey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilbert died of <a href="https://archives.fruiterers.org.uk/gallery_image/5340/enlarge/">pneumonia</a> on 18th December 1908, age 42.</p>
