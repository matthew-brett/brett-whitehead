		<p>Gilbert Hinds was born on 26 May 1866, the fifth child of <a
href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/whitehead-hinds/">James Whitehead and Mercy Matilda
Hinds</a>.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/helena-emmeline-langford/">married Helena Emmeline
Langford</a> in 1901.</p>
<p>In 1890, he became a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of
Fruiterers and a Freeman of the City of London — see his profile in the
<a href="https://archives.fruiterers.org.uk/gallery/816/">archives of
the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers</a>. His <a

<p>The book <a
href="https://archive.org/details/armorialfamilies02foxd">Armorial
families by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (7th Edition, Hurst &amp; Blackett
Ltd, Londdon, 1929)</a> (p 2079) has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gilbert Hinds Whitehead, Esq., late Capt. 8th Vol. Batt. Rifle
Brigade, b. May 26, 1866, d. 1908; m. April 10, 1901, Helena Emmeline,
d. of the late H. A. Langford of Plymouth, and has left issue — Margaret
Joy [m. Lieut. John Brett, R.N.]. Res.— Newhaven, Eltham.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilbert was the assignee of a <a
href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US754311A/en">1903 patent for
interleaving printed sheets of paper with tissue paper</a>.</p>
<p>Martin Brett:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He and his younger brother together ran a lithographic printing
company — hence the invention for interleaving plates with tissue paper.
Their big sellers were one of the versions of Holman Hunt’s Light of the
World and a rather terrifying print of a heavily tattooed Maori woman,
both found very widely in the nurseries of their acquaintance. […] Entry
into a livery company was standard for moderately prosperous commercial
families, I think, and it was largely formulaic. I don’t believe
Grandfather W. ever had any significant interest in fruit-selling.</p>
<p>The address in the armorial is the house which was built for them by
Gt Grandfafher James, where Granny W. lived (except for part of the
second war) until her death in 1951. I was born in the Eltham hospital
when Granny Joy, Sue and Jen were looking for a permanent home, and my
father was long at sea, and we returned there from Devon in (I think)
early 1947. After Granny Whitehead’s death the house was sold and we
moved to Surrey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilbert died of <a
href="https://archives.fruiterers.org.uk/gallery_image/5340/enlarge/">pneumonia</a>
on 18th December 1908, age 42. Martin Brett remembers a family account
of Gilbert’s final illness; at one point Gilbert had recovered enough to
walk round the garden, but then relapsed and died.</p>
