<p>The Dictionary of National Biography (1912) on <a
href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Brett,_John_(DNB12)">John Brett
(the painter)</a>. “BRETT, JOHN (1831–1902), landscape painter, born at
Bletchingley, Surrey, on 8 Dec. 1831, was eldest son of Captain Charles
Curtis Brett of the 12th lancers by his wife Ann Philbrick. […] He died
in his house at Putney on 8 Jan. 1902. He married in 1870, and had four
sons and three daughters who survived him. A portrait in oils by
himself, painted about 1865, belongs to his son, Mr. Michael Brett.”</p>
<p>The current ODNB article (behind a paywall) adds “Captain Charles
Curtis Brett (1789–1865), an army veterinarian” and “Ann Pilbean (b.
1808/9)”. “About 1870 Brett met, and later married, Mary Ann Howcroft
(b. 1844/5), with whom he had seven children, the first being born in
either 1871 or 1872.”</p>
<p>His parents were <a href="/brett-whitehead/brett-pilbean/">Charles Curtis
Brett and Ann Pilbean</a>.</p>
<p>John settled and had a <a href="/brett-whitehead/brett-howcroft/">family
with Mary Ann Howcroft</a>.</p>
