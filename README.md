John [died in World War
2](https://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1941-05MAY2.htm), when his ship [HMS

John was the son of Michael Brett, who was the eldest son of [John Brett, the
painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brett_(artist)).

He was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 September 1918, and gained these ranks:

* Midshipman: 15 January 1923
* Sub-Lieutenant: 15 November 1925
* Lieutenant: 15 November 1927
* Lieutenant-Commander: 15 November 1935.

but I can't find John Brett at this link, now or via <https://archive.org>.

John was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, [announced 11th September
1940](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34943/supplement/5469), and
Mention in Dispatches [announced 17 June
1941](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35191/supplement/3436)

The Dictionary of National Biography (1912) on [John Brett (the
painter)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Brett,_John_(DNB12)). "BRETT, JOHN
(1831–1902), landscape painter, born at Bletchingley, Surrey, on 8 Dec. 1831,
was eldest son of Captain Charles Curtis Brett of the 12th lancers by his wife
Ann Philbrick. [...] He died in his house at Putney on 8 Jan. 1902. He married
in 1870, and had four sons and three daughters who survived him. A portrait in
oils by himself, painted about 1865, belongs to his son, Mr. Michael Brett. "

The current ODNB article (behind a paywall) adds "Captain Charles Curtis Brett
(1789–1865), an army veterinarian" and "Ann Pilbean (b. 1808/9)".  "About 1870
Brett met, and later married, Mary Ann Howcroft (b. 1844/5), with whom he had
seven children, the first being born in either 1871 or 1872. "

There is a Mary Ann Brett at [this MyHeritage.com
page](https://www.myheritage.com/names/mary_howcroft) that appears to match
John's partner and Michael's mother.

[FeeBMD](https://www.freebmd.org.uk) has no record of a marriage between "John
Brett" and someone with surname "Howcroft" between 1840 and 1902.

[Rosa Brett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Brett) was John (the painter's)
older sister.  The ODNB has "Brett, Rosa [pseud. Rosarius] (1829–1882),
painter, was born on 7 December 1829 and baptized at St George's, Camberwell,
Surrey, on 26 March 1830, the eldest of the five children of Captain Charles
Curtis Brett (1789–1865), veterinary surgeon in the 12th lancers, and his wife,
Ann, née Pilbean (b. 1808/9), of Tonbridge, Kent."

## Whiteheads

### Margaret Joy Whitehead:

<http://www.thepeerage.com/p31682.htm>

Margaret Joy Whitehead was the daughter of Gilbert Hinds Whitehead and Helena
Emmeline Langford. She married John Brett on 5 May 1928, and Robert Clement
Giles on 24th July 1965.

Source is Burke's Peerage.

According to <http://www.thepeerage.com/p31681.htm#i316808>, Gilbert Hinds
Whitehead was the fifth son of [Sir James Whitehead, 1st
Baronet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_James_Whitehead,_1st_Baronet) and
Mercy Matilda Hinds.  Further links there say Helena Emmeline Langford was the
daughter of Henry A. Langford, but no mention of her mother. This site claims
she was born on 10 April 1901 and died in 1949.

```

I can't find a birth certificate for Helena or Emmeline Langford, between 1890
and 1910.
