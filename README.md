According to <http://www.thepeerage.com/p31681.htm#i316808>, Gilbert Hinds
Whitehead was the fifth son of [Sir James Whitehead, 1st
Baronet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_James_Whitehead,_1st_Baronet) and
Mercy Matilda Hinds.  Further links there say Helena Emmeline Langford was the
daughter of Henry A. Langford, but no mention of her mother. This site claims
she was born on 10 April 1901 and died in 1949.

I can't find a birth certificate for Helena or Emmeline Langford, between 1890
and 1910.
