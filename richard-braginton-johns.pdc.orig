1892](https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=6jQAQQG%2BeFY%2BEJcwzNlOZw&scan=1)

He was a lieutenant in the 20th Hussars in the 1914-18 war. His [National

I can't find anything convincing for George Edmund.  There is a compatible BMD
record for a [death in

Georgiana died on holiday with Richard in Italy, in 1937. The record appears in
the free search for "Georgiana Johns" in the "Western Morning News" at
<https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk>, but the full version quoted here
is from [this Wikitree page](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-7010):

> DIED IN ITALY
>
> Wife of a Plymouth Magistrate. Many friends in Plymouth will
learn with regret of the death abroad of Mrs Georgiana Lucy
Johns, wife of Mr. R. B. Johns solicitor and city magistrate,
of Plymouth, who had resided at The Terrace, The Hoe. Mrs Johns
had been on a holiday visit to Italy with Mr. Johns, and death
occurred at Menaggio, Italy, after short illness.

[Her probate](/images/georgiana_lucy_johns_probate_1937.png) benefits her
husband, and Flora Georgiana Deacon, the daughter from her first marriage (see

William Ernest Blakeney solicitor, and his step-daughter Flora Georgiana
