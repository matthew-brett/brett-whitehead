<p>Helena Emmeline preferred “Emmeline”.</p>
<p>Emmeline lived with “Aunt Alice” and an unfriendly vicar in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zennor">Zennor, in Cornwall</a>. She (Granny Whitehead) would do an impression of the thick accent of the postman.</p>
<p>A distant relative, surname Johns, gave a significant amount of money to Emmeline in his will, enough to buy a car.</p>
<h2 id="another-conversation-maybe-in-june">Another conversation maybe in June</h2>
<p>Joan, John and Peter Brett were the <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/brett-lee/">three children of Michael Brett and Nellie Mary Lee</a>.</p>
<p>Confirming Joan Brett married Cecil Hay, who died during the occupation in Signapore.</p>
<p>Their children were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alison (presumably Keating - see <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/brett-lee/">Brett-Lee</a>- an aeronautical engineer</li>
<li>Sally Pursail</li>
<li>John Brett. John is a specialist in Chinese art. He married a Chinese woman, ?Tu Min. They had two sons. He emigrated to the US at some point. He divorced, and remarried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peter Brett worked for ICI. He was a keen and successful sailor. In later life he designed and sold yachts, of 35 ft class 3, with the original called “Fair Rover”. One of his children is Jane Ash, who is, like her aunt Alison, an aeronautical engineer.</p>
