> It seems that Clara's younger brother William Newell Vicary emigrated to Stafford, Genesee County, New York possibly between the births of his daughter Caroline Merrill Vicary (who seems to have been born in Devon in time to be baptized early in 1848) and his daughter Annie Maria (who is listed on censuses as being born in New York in November 1849).
>
> William passed away in 1889.  Maybe Clara Louisa came to help out....unfortunately  most of the 1890 US Census is missing.  There is an 1892 census for New York.  Maybe if you looked at each of William Newell Vicary's children in the States, you might find her living with or getting remarried near or buried near one of them.

A [list if Stafford (NY) Cemetery inscriptions](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915235429/http://genesee.bettysgenealogy.org/grave.htm)

FamilySearch for Clara Louisa, birth 1835 to 1839 England, in the NY
1892 census, gives various options, none of them very compelling.
I investigated [Louisa
Linville](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:2:1K8C-8JB), but
she has the same husband and daughter in the UK census of 1871
(FamilySearch, James Linvill).

There is a [Clara
Tayler](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVPN-VYGF),
estimated birth year 1837, who immigrated to New York from England in
1882, with "Jos Tayler", age 50, on the ship "Service".  I couldn't
find anything convincing for either of these, FamilySearching with
alternative name "Taylor" and their relevant birth year ranges.
