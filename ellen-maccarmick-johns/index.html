		<p>Ellen was born in 1859 to <a href="/brett-whitehead/johns-braginton/">Edmund
Allen Johns and Clara Louisa Braginton</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/names/ellen_stawell">Ellen’s
MyHeritage entry</a> for more hints, and <a
href="/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD birth records</a>.</p>
<p>She was living with her <a
href="/brett-whitehead/clara-louisa-braginton/">mother</a> as of the 1881 census, and
<a
href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=sDklgRdiJxbxr6kmxJYW%2FA&amp;scan=1">married
George Stawell</a> that year.</p>
<p>In the <a
href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:W4P8-TN2">1891
census</a>, she is living in Plymouth with her husband, a cook and a
servant. For the <a
href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSWK-KZZ">1901
census</a> she is still living with her husband, and two different
servants, but now in Great Torrington, Devon. For <a
