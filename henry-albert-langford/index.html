		<p>Henry Albert was probably born in Liskeard in late 1837 (<a
href="/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD record</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/brett-whitehead/langford-braginton/">He married Clara Louisa Johns
(née Braginton)</a> in 1866.</p>
<p><a href="../docs/langford_he_birth_1872.pdf">His daughter’s birth
certificate</a> gives his profession as “general merchant” in 1872. His
probate and death certificate (see below) gives his profession as
“accountant”.</p>
<p>There is a grave for “Henry A Langford” in St Mary’s Church,
Callington, Cornwall, with inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Henry A Langford who departed this life June 24th 1879, aged 41
years. “His end was peace”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/henry_langford_grave.jpg" /></p>
<p>His <a href="../docs/langford_ha_death_cert_1872.pdf">death
certificate</a> gives the cause of death as “Pulmonary Phthisis; Several
months; Certified by John Kempthorne FRCS” <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Pulmonary phthisis is tuberculosis. Henry’s brother E C Langford
registered the death; the brother has an address in Plymouth.</p>
<p>See <a href="../images/langford_ha_probate_1881.jpg">Henry A Langford
probate listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LANGFORD, Henry Albert. Personal estate £28 13s. 1881, 10 December.
Administration of the Personal Estate of Henry Albert Langford late of
Callington in the county of Cornwall Accountant who died 24 June 1879 in
Callington was granted at Bodmin to Clara Louisa Langford of 5
North-Hill- terrace Plymouth in the County of Devon Widow of the
Relict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and
Administrations), 1858-1966 - Ancestry.com - 1,1904::0 -
1,1904::5114587</p>
<p>Three things stand out from this death certificate and probate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Henry Albert is living in Callington, which is about 15 miles away
from Plymouth, where his children were born, and where his wife was
living two years later for the census. Maybe he had moved out of the
family home. His brother certified the death, rather than his wife - was
this typical?</li>
<li>The probate seems to have taken a long time; he died in June 1879,
but the probate is resolved a year and half later in December 1881.</li>
<li>He only left £28; that seems strangely small given his profession
“Accountant”.</li>
