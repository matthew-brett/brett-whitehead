		<p>Family page for Edmund Allen Johns and <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/clara-louisa-braginton/">Clara Louisa Braginton</a>.</p>
<p>They married in 1857. See their <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/marriage_johns_braginton/">marriage record transcription</a>, and the <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD record</a>.</p>
<p>From the page above, and the census records below, and that listed in <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/helena-emmeline-langford/">Helena Emmeline Langford’s page</a>, Clara Louisa and Edmund Allen had at least three children:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/ellen-maccarmick-johns/">Ellen Maccarmick Johns</a> (1859 — 1938).</li>
<li><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/richard-braginton-johns/">Richard Braginton Johns</a> (1862 — 1952).</li>
<li><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/edmund-allen-johns/">Edmund Allen Johns</a> (1865 - 1929).</li>
</ul>
<p>Bill Cooke (see below) tells me that Edmund Allen Johns (the father) was baptized on 21 Sep 1830 in Gerrans, Cornwall, England. He died in Veryan, near Truro on 2 November 1864, age 34. See <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/bmd_records/">BMD death record</a>), and <a href="http://sites.rootsweb.com/~enggerop/gerrans_mis_f_m.htm">this grave inscription</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sacred to the memory of Philippa Maccarmick Johns Who departed this life The 8? day of October 1857 Aged 14 years and 8 months She lives whom we call dead Also of her youngest brother Edmund Allen Johns Who was suddenly called from this life November 2nd 1864 aged 34 years We trust in the living God who is the Saviour of all men specially of those That believe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Royal Cornwall Gazette gave a short report of his death on Friday 4 November 1864. See <a href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=edmund%20johns%2c%20esq">this search</a> for details. The text is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FATAL ACCIDENT AT VERYAN. On Wednesday evening about 6 o’clock, as Edmund Johns, Esq., brother to Fendarves Johns, Esq., of Trewince, Gerrans, was returning on horseback from Tregony to his brother’s residence, he was thrown from his horse, near Bessy Benath gate, and was killed on the spot. Mr Nott, the toll gate keeper, saw the horse trotting past the gate without a rider, and knowing it to be the one he saw Mr Johns riding by in the afternoon, he sent his son after the horse, and went back himself along the road to see what had become of Mr Johns. About 100 yards from the gate he found the unfortunate man lying on his face in a pool of blood, apparently quite dead. Mr Prynne, surgeon, of High Lanes, was sent for and was quickly in attendance, but his efforts to restore animation were unavailing. The deceased was then removed to the house of Mr John Furze, Ruanhighlanes, to await an inquest.</p>
