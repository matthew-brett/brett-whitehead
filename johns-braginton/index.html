grave inscription</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sacred to the memory of Philippa Maccarmick Johns Who departed this
life The 8? day of October 1857 Aged 14 years and 8 months She lives
whom we call dead Also of her youngest brother Edmund Allen Johns Who
was suddenly called from this life November 2nd 1864 aged 34 years We
trust in the living God who is the Saviour of all men specially of those
That believe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Royal Cornwall Gazette gave a short report of his death on Friday
4 November 1864. See <a
href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=edmund%20johns%2c%20esq">this
search</a> for details. The text is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FATAL ACCIDENT AT VERYAN. On Wednesday evening about 6 o’clock, as
Edmund Johns, Esq., brother to Fendarves Johns, Esq., of Trewince,
Gerrans, was returning on horseback from Tregony to his brother’s
residence, he was thrown from his horse, near Bessy Benath gate, and was
killed on the spot. Mr Nott, the toll gate keeper, saw the horse
trotting past the gate without a rider, and knowing it to be the one he
saw Mr Johns riding by in the afternoon, he sent his son after the
horse, and went back himself along the road to see what had become of Mr
Johns. About 100 yards from the gate he found the unfortunate man lying
on his face in a pool of blood, apparently quite dead. Mr Prynne,
surgeon, of High Lanes, was sent for and was quickly in attendance, but
his efforts to restore animation were unavailing. The deceased was then
removed to the house of Mr John Furze, Ruanhighlanes, to await an
inquest.</p>
