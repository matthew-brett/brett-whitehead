<p>There is only one <a
href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=M4V9%2FrSdhTqxgFD3%2FjZu7g&amp;scan=1">marriage
for an Edmund Johns</a> in a search from 1880 to 1929. The marriage was
in Bideford, in 1896, but the Edmund Johns from the corresponding
certificate was 25 at the time, when Edmund Allen Johns would have been
29. There’s a matching <a
href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2X73-JWL">birth record for
this other Edmund Johns</a> in 1869, in Bideford.</p>
<p>The 1911 census has Edmund Allen visiting his aunt’s husband <a
href="/brett-whitehead/samuel-henry-farwell-roe/">Samuel Farwell Roe</a>, with a
profession recorded as “Private Means”.</p>
<p>There is a 1930 <a
href="https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/">probate entry</a> for
Edmond Allen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JOHNS Edmond Allen of Penhallam Great Torrington Devonshire died 26
November 1929 Administration London 31 January to Richard Braginton
Johns solicitor. Effects £1747 7s 9d.</p>
</blockquote>

Administrations), 1858-1966 - Ancestry.com - 1,1904::0 -

<p>It’s difficult to know whether his probate means he had no surviving
wife or children.</p>
