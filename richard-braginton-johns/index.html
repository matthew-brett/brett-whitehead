		<p>Richard was born on <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/braginton_richard_descendants.pdf">18 October 1862</a> (also <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2N8V-TNL">FamilySearch record</a> to <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/johns-braginton/">Edmund Allen Johns and Clara Louisa Braginton</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/richard-braginton-johns-24-qy2hdl">Richard Braginton Johns Ancestry.com page</a> for more suggestions.</p>
<p>He married <a href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=qFnFz44Z8kjzz9N%2FyRFivw&amp;scan=1">Mary Sherwin</a> in 1889. Mary <a href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=wYyAzYWxxrwwwE3Nsy9lRA&amp;scan=1">probably died in 1898</a>.</p>
<p>In 1902 he <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QLH8-DS6N">married Georgiana Lucy Deacon</a></p>
<p>See this <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-7010">Wikitree page for Georgiana</a>.</p>
<p>His household in Plymouth in the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XW9K-NSV">1911 census</a> is his wife, two children (see below) and a cook, two servants, a governess, a chauffeur and a stable boy.</p>
<p>His children from the 1911 census were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard Allen Pendomer (?) Johns, age 18</li>
<li>George Edward (?) Wolfe Johns, age 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard Allen Pendarves Johns was born in Plymouth <a href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=6jQAQQG%2BeFY%2BEJcwzNlOZw&amp;scan=1">around September 1892</a></p>
<p>He was a lieutenant in the 20th Hussars in the 1914-18 war. His <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D8278047">National Archives service record</a> has him:</p>
<ul>
<li>With next of kin R. B. Johns, of Plymouth, Father.</li>
<li>Reported missing in France on 23 May 1917.</li>
<li>Unofficially reported wounded and prisoner of war in 4 June 1917.</li>
<li>Noted as “Dead” but this crossed out in one of two places.</li>
<li>Repatriated prisoner of war on 5 January 1919.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, he died in India, in 1922, aged around 29. From the free search for “Richard Allen Johns” in the “Western Morning News” at <a href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk" class="uri">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPLD-B1Y6">Richard Allen’s beneficiary</a> was his father.</p>
<p>George Edmund Wolfe Johns was born <a href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=6uCMwgPKzNgJ2E7BAndS8A&amp;scan=1">around December 1906</a></p>
<p>I can’t find anything convincing for George Edmund. There is a compatible BMD record for a <a href="https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=o%2B6zUeTD08I5i8dK9E1Zzw&amp;scan=1">death in 1925</a>, but that isn’t strong evidence.</p>
<p>Georgiana died on holiday with Richard in Italy, in 1937. The record appears in the free search for “Georgiana Johns” in the “Western Morning News” at <a href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk" class="uri">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk</a>, but the full version quoted here is from <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-7010">this Wikitree page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DIED IN ITALY</p>
<p>Wife of a Plymouth Magistrate. Many friends in Plymouth will learn with regret of the death abroad of Mrs Georgiana Lucy Johns, wife of Mr. R. B. Johns solicitor and city magistrate, of Plymouth, who had resided at The Terrace, The Hoe. Mrs Johns had been on a holiday visit to Italy with Mr. Johns, and death occurred at Menaggio, Italy, after short illness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/georgiana_lucy_johns_probate_1937.png">Her probate</a> benefits her husband, and Flora Georgiana Deacon, the daughter from her first marriage (see Wikitree link above).</p>
<p>Richard himself <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/richard_braginton_johns_probate_1952.png">died on 22 July 1952</a>, leaving his £82940 to William Ernest Blakeney solicitor, and his step-daughter Flora Georgiana Deacon.</p>
