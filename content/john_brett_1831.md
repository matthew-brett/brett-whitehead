The Dictionary of National Biography (1912) on [John Brett (the
painter)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Brett,_John_(DNB12)). "BRETT, JOHN
(1831–1902), landscape painter, born at Bletchingley, Surrey, on 8 Dec. 1831,
was eldest son of Captain Charles Curtis Brett of the 12th lancers by his wife
Ann Philbrick. [...] He died in his house at Putney on 8 Jan. 1902. He married
in 1870, and had four sons and three daughters who survived him. A portrait in
oils by himself, painted about 1865, belongs to his son, Mr. Michael Brett. "

The current ODNB article (behind a paywall) adds "Captain Charles Curtis Brett
(1789–1865), an army veterinarian" and "Ann Pilbean (b. 1808/9)".  "About 1870
Brett met, and later married, Mary Ann Howcroft (b. 1844/5), with whom he had
seven children, the first being born in either 1871 or 1872. "

There is a Mary Ann Brett at [this MyHeritage.com
page](https://www.myheritage.com/names/mary_howcroft) that appears to match
John's partner and Michael's mother.

[FeeBMD](https://www.freebmd.org.uk) has no record of a marriage between "John
Brett" and someone with surname "Howcroft" between 1840 and 1902.

[Rosa Brett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Brett) was John (the painter's)
older sister.  The ODNB has "Brett, Rosa [pseud. Rosarius] (1829–1882),
painter, was born on 7 December 1829 and baptized at St George's, Camberwell,
Surrey, on 26 March 1830, the eldest of the five children of Captain Charles
Curtis Brett (1789–1865), veterinary surgeon in the 12th lancers, and his wife,
Ann, née Pilbean (b. 1808/9), of Tonbridge, Kent."

> His father, Charles Curtis Brett, had a background in both the army and the
> navy. He served as a midshipman on HMS Egmont, a 74-gun warship, between 1816
> and 1823. In 1833, he joined the Twelfth Lancers, an army regiment, as a
> veterinary surgeon, and he continued to work in the army until his retirement
