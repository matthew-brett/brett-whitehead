Clara Louisa Braginton]({{< relref "johns-braginton.pdc" >}}).

There is only one [marriage for an Edmund
Johns](https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=M4V9%2FrSdhTqxgFD3%2FjZu7g&scan=1)
in a search from 1880 to 1929. The marriage was in Bideford, in 1896, but the
Edmund Johns from the corresponding certificate was 25 at the time, when
Edmund Allen Johns would have been 29.  There's a matching [birth record for
this other Edmund Johns](https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2X73-JWL) in
1869, in Bideford.

The 1911 census has Edmund Allen visiting his aunt's husband [Samuel Farwell
Roe]( {{< relref "samuel-henry-farwll-roe.pdc" >}}), with a profession
recorded as "Private Means".

It's difficult to know whether his probate means he had no surviving wife or children.
