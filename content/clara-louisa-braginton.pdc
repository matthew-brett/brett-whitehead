Clara Louisa's parents were [George Braginton and Margaret Grace Vicary]({{< relref "braginton-vicary.pdc" >}}).

Also see [this page on Braginton family history]({{< relref
"braginton_history.pdc"
>}}).

From that page: Clara Louisa's father was a shipowner, and probably named one
of his ships "Clara Louisa" after his daughter.

Clara was born in 1837 - see [BMD record]({{< relref "bmd_records.pdc" >}}).

[Clara Louisa married Edmund Allen Johns]({{< relref "johns-braginton.pdc"
>}}) in 1857.  They had three children.  Edmund Allen died in 1864.

[Clara Louisa married Henry Alfred Langford]({{< relref
"langford-braginton.pdc" >}}) in 1866.  [Henry Langford]({{< relref
"henry-alfred-langford.pdc" >}}) died in 1879, leaving an estate of Â£28.

In the 1881 census, Clara Louisa Langford was a widow again, living at 5 North
Hills Terrace, with the following household:

| Name  | Age | Relation | Marriage | Profession |
|-------| ----|----------|----------|------------|
| Clara Louisa Langford  | 42 | Head | Widow | Lady |
| Ellen Macornick Johns  | 22 | Daughter | Single | Lady |
| Richard Braginton Johns  | 18 | Son | Single | Solicitor's articled clerk |
| Helena Emmilina Langford  | 8 | Daughter | Single | Scholar |
| George Stawell Tuckey  | 27 | Visitor | Single | Solicitor |
| Fanny Gent  | 47 | Servant | Single | Cook Domestic |
| Elizabeth Dunn  | 16 | Servant | Single | Housemaid |

I can't find Clara Louisa in the 1891 census.  This may be because she had
emigrated to the United States; in [this 23 September 1892 record of a
conveyance](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/b86617aa-7793-4abf-9b2b-ad28d109ed29),
along with some other familiar dramatis personae, Clara Louisa is listed as:

> Clara Louisa Langford of New York, U.S.A., widow."

It's interesting that she seems to have emigrated to the US on her own,
leaving her family behind; at least, she has not changed her surname for the
conveyance documents.

I can't find any plausible record of her travel to the US in the US
immigration databases, searching for "Langford", "Clara" and "Louisa".
