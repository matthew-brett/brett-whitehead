Martin Brett tells me that "Granny Whitehead" preferred "Emmeline".

Emmeline's parents were [Henry Albert Langford and Clara Louisa Braginton]({{<
relref "langford-braginton.pdc" >}}).

[Emmeline married Gilbert Hinds Whitehead]({{< relref "whitehead-langford.pdc"
>}}).

In 1891 Emmeline is living at 8 Roman Road, Chiswick, with her half-brother,
and one of the same servants, Fanny Gent:

[Martin Brett tells me]({{< relref "talk_to_martin.pdc" >}}) that Emmeline
spent a long time in Cornwall, with her Aunt Alice in Zennor, in Cornwall.

Aunt Alice must be [Alice Jane
Braginton](https://gw.geneanet.org/jankingshott?n=braginton&oc=&p=alice+jane),
Clara Louisa's sister. She married Samuel Henry Farwell Roe:

Farwell Roe was vicar of Zennor, Corwall, from around 1888, to around 1900,
when he moved to St Micheal Penkevil, near Truro, also in Cornwall.

Sure enough, Emmeline is in the vicarage of St Michael Penkevil, as Helena
E Langford, for the 1901 survey.  This was soon before she [married Gilbert
Hinds Whitehead]({{< relref "whitehead-langford.pdc" >}}).

There is a 1930 [probate entry](https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/) for
Emmeline's half-brother:

> JOHNS Edmond Allen of Penhallam Great Torrington Devonshire died 26 November
> 1929 Administration London 31 January to Richard Braginton Johns solicitor.
> Effects Â£1747 7s 9d.

Some of this money from her half-brother may have reached Emmeline.
