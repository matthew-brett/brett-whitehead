<p>LATE MR. R. A. P. JOHNS</p>
<p>PLYMOUTH CORONER’S BEREAVEMENT</p>
<p>We regret to announce the death in India of the son of Mr. R. B.
Johns, the coroner for Plymouth.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Allen Pendarves Johns, aged 30, was shooting on Lake Adra
last Thursday, and entering the water while recovering a bird his feet
became entangled in the weeds, and he was drowned before aid could be
procured.</p>
<p>Mr. Johns was educated at Marlborough College, and served with the
20th Hussars during the war, afterwards joining the Royal Air Force. He
was a prisoner of war for some time, and was demobilized in 1920.</p>
<p>Sympathy will be extended to Mr. R. B. Johns in his bereavement.</p>
