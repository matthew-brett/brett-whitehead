		<p><a href="http://stalkingdeadpeople.blogspot.com">William Cooke</a>
sent much of the information on this page, including the <a
href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/vicary_bible_transcription.pdf">transcription of the
Vicary family bible</a>. Thank you to him, for his great generosity in
sharing his research, and his care in doing it.</p>
<p>Quoting the transcript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1835 - Jan 13th. The above named Margaret Grace Relict of the above
named William Cotton was married in the Church of St. Giles in the Wood
- Devon - to George Braginton Son of Richard Branginton &amp; Anne his
wife</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that transcript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1806- Thomas Cornish Vicary (surgeon)(Son of Wm and Grace Vicary
formerly Cornish) married Margaret Fry (dr of Thos. and Elenora Fry late
Lock) on the sixth day of March, 1806, at Gt. Torrington,Devon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas and Margaret had three children:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1807 - Oct. 30th Margaret Grace Daughter to the above was born,
privately baptised Nov. 30th &amp; registered - publically baptised
Dec</p>
<p>1809 - Feb. 23rd Thos. Merril, son to the above was born - privately
baptised the 25th (registered this date) publically baptised March 16th,
1809 at Gt. Torrington</p>
<p>1810 - Dec. 31st William Newell son of the above was born - privately
baptized Jan 7th ,1811 and publically baptized March 6th, 1811 at Great
Torrington, Devon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin Brett, son of <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/brett-whitehead/">John Brett
and Joy Whitehead</a>, rescued four portraits of the Vicarys, that Joy
Brett (Whitehead) was about to throw onto a bonfire.</p>
<p>Here’s the portrait of Merril Vicary:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/vicary_merril.jpg" /></p>
<p>A label on the back of that picture tells us this is “Merril Vicary.
Son of Dr. Vicary”:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/vicary_merril_back.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here are Dr and Mrs Vicary — presumably Thomas Cornish Vicary and
Margaret Vicary (née Fry).</p>

<p><img src="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/images/vicary_mrs.jpg" /></p>
<p>The final portrait of the series must be Margaret Grace, <a
href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/brett-whitehead/braginton-vicary/">mother of Clara Louisa
Braginton</a>.</p>
